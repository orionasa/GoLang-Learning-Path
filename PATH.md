Of course. Here is a more detailed and granular version of the GoLang learning path, breaking down broader modules into smaller, more digestible topics. This revised path ensures each module has a clear and focused objective.

### **Revised GoLang Learning Path: From 0 to Hero**

This restructured path divides complex topics into dedicated modules to provide a more gradual and manageable learning curve. The timeline has been adjusted to reflect the increased granularity, ensuring each concept can be thoroughly understood before moving to the next.
